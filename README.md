Event: FORCE Machine Learning Hackathon, Stavanger 2018 https://events.agilescientific.com/event/force-hackathon

Project: Extract good shows from 400 well reports https://events.agilescientific.com/project/extract-oil-show-confidence-from-pdf-reports

Team: Jesse Lord, Anne Estoppey, Kaouther Hadji, Chris Olsen, Florian Basier

Methodology:
1. OCR PDFs (provided: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ew1Re1LhLSOvculHYPrzqcKiYU3Oo3rU)
2. Extract text from PDFs
3. Find common phrases, beyond the obvious "good shows"
4. For each phrase, search for a 4 digit number that is nearby in the document
5. SMEs label each of the matches as a good show, or not
6. Train/Test split, vectorization, then linear regression
7. Visualise matches at depth on a map, and colour code confidence for each match. Run the UI using NPM, then choose the included csv once presented with the interface. 

The pipeline module contains the code blocks required to perform the above methodology. 
Each block typically outputs to a csv, that is picked up by the next:
1. phrases_csv will generate bigrams and trigrams from a list of indicators
2. extract_pdf will read pdfs (expected to be in data\reports) to a dataframe
3. count_phrases stores the count of phrases (from step 1) found in the pdf text dataframe 
4. top_phrases shows the top n phrases using the count_phrases csv: most hits and most docs 
5. extract_phrases searches for nearby 4 digit numbers in each document, for each phrase, and stores the word distance between phrase and depth
6. label starts an interactive labelling of the matches found in step 5
7. wb_xy uses regex to get the wellbore from each filename, then the coordinates found in data\csv\wb_latlon.csv to assign a location to each wellbore
8. learn performs a train/test split, applies a count vectorizer, adds depth and distance as features, then performs logistic regression, outputting auc and confidence

Results:
Using only the phrase 'good show', 44 matches with depth were found. After splitting there were only 11 records left to test on. While the results were perfect, this clearly isn't enough of a sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions. Our next step, if we had the time, was to select common phrases generated from the indicators vocabulary, and run this pipeline again. 

The count/top phrase searches for trigrams did not complete before the event was done, but we did have a look at the top bigrams:
